                    <li class="lh-lg">Simultaneously, invitations accompanied with our brochure are posted to many more companies requesting their presence.</li>
                    <li class="lh-lg">You can communicate your requirements / intent to select our students, by either of our Communication Channels or the Show Interest, made available online.</li>
                    <li class="lh-lg">As per your convenience, our team will send you the profiles or the Curriculum Vitae of the students interested, for your scrutiny & short-listing suiting your criterion. You can choose to conduct your process at our campus as well, for General Discussion and Final Interview</li>
                    <li class="lh-lg">Should you choose to visit us, we would be glad to make any of the logistics arrangement, in terms of your travel to our campus or during the conduction of the process at our Institute. However, a pre-planned visit would enable a smooth conduction of the entire process.</li>
